# Nuxt UI Components
This is a collection of UI components created in Nuxt 3.

### This is under development. Changes will occur and the project is still in early stages of development.

## Why did I create this?

I got tired of different UI components with their somewhat limited styling.  
I was also wishing for of a "copy and paste" style of UI components.

I found out about [WindUI](https://wind-ui.com/components/buttons/) which is for React and gave the hard source code to different components. I enjoyed the experience of having full control of the components.

Now I just want the same experience in Nuxt.

## How does this work?
In your own project: 

1. Make sure you have tailwind installed. [Guide](https://nuxt.com/modules/tailwindcss).  

2. Next you need to install tailwind-variants. [Guide](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/docs/getting-started). 

Now in this repositories [components](components/) folder you can find a bunch of UI components.  
Copy the ones you want into your own project and start playing with them.



## Notice!
I have no clue if these UI components work on Nuxt 3 or Vue because I haven't tested.
So if anyone cares to test and tell me, thanks!
